## Always use MFA
Strong passwords aren’t secure enough anymore. Attackers have developed several tested methods of stealing credentials, giving them unauthorized access to private accounts.

For this reason, requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all your GitHub organizations is critical.
> MFA should be enforced for every GitHub user in your organizations.
>> To require MFA, select Your Profile Photo → Your Organizations → Settings → Security → Authentication Security. For more details, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization).
