# AZ QuickStart

Demonstration/starter Drupal distribution and installation profile that packages
various features consistent with community best practices and UA brand strategy.

## A Complete Customized Drupal

AZ QuickStart is a complete customized version of the popular Drupal content
management system, not an add-on to an existing Drupal-based web site.
Previously, to start a new Drupal site you would prepare a web server and
database, then download the Drupal core software from drupal.org and install it
(following the instructions at https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install).
This would produce a minimally functional web site with no content, which you
could then customize by adding themes and modules to fit it to your needs.
Increasingly, however, you can download Drupal distributions, which not only
contain the core, but also complete sets of additions to make it almost
immediately useful for a particular purpose, such as an online storefront. AZ
QuickStart is the distribution that provides many of the features specific to
the University of Arizona, and rather than an empty site, initially shows some
demonstration content (which can nevertheless be turned off instantly).

## Included modular functionality
 - [Quickstart CAS](/modules/custom/az_cas) - Preconfigures integration with the
   Univeristy of Arizona webauth system.
