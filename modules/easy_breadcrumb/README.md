# Easy Breadcrumb

The Easy Breadcrumb module updates the core Breadcrumb block to include
the current page title in the breadcrumb. The module also comes with additional
settings that are common features needed in breadcrumbs.

Breadcrumbs use the current URL (path alias) and the current page title to
build the crumbs. The module is designed to work out of the box with no adjustments,
and it comes with settings to customize the crumbs.

For a full description of the module, visit the
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/easy_breadcrumb).

     prefix ("/en") is used.
   - Use menu title as fallback instead of raw path component.
