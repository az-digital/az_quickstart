# Metatag Routes

The Metatag Routes module allows a user to configure metatags for custom
controllers generated by code.

It uses the metatags entity to store a configuration for any route using the
metatags administration.

The module adds a button in the default metatag dashboard page giving the user
the option to enter the route path and validates if the path has a defined
route, the route is not administrative and the route is "metatag-able".

## Configuration

1. Navigate to Administration > Extend and enable the module.
2. Navigate to Administration > Configuration > Search and Metadata >
   Metatag to configure metatags.
3. Select "Add meta tag for custom route" and enter the path for which you
   want to add the metatags.
4. Submit.
