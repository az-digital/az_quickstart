## Introduction
The Configuration Update Manager project consists of two modules:

Configuration Update Base: A base module providing functionality related to
  updating and computing differences between configuration versions. No
  user interface; used by other modules such as Features.

Configuration Update Reports (in the config_update_ui sub-directory of this
  project): Adds an updates report and revert functionality to configuration
  management. Depends on Configuration Update Base. For more information, see
  the README file in the subdirectory.
