  2/24/2016

* [x] Media entity image/video, and Video embed field lazyloading, if any.  
  10/25/2016

  Added both simple Blazy Media formatter and Views field Media Entity.

* [x] Makes a solid lazyloading solution for IMG, DIV, IFRAME tags.  
  4/9/2017

  Added IFRAME (Blazy Video), apart from existing IMG/ DIV (CSS background).

* [x] Core Media integration.  
  01/03/2019 (basic) - 15/08/2023 (full-fledged)

* [x] Core Responsive Image integration.  
  05/02/2020   

  Added multi-breakpoint CSS background and Aspect ratio Fluid supports.

* [?] Optimization and solidification aka maturity.

  Why is it the last plan? It should make sense, if you have heard **premature
  optimization** in software developments.
