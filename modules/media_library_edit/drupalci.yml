# This file customizes the steps that DrupalCI will use when testing this project.
#
# The primary customization provided here is to check for deprecation errors. It is recommended
# to do this only when you've used https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/ to verify any
# existing deprecation errors are addressed.
