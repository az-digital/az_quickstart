  ## Before running the file migration, please configure the file location.

  File can be migrated in two ways as below -

  #### 1. Copy the file  "sites/default/files/migrate_file" folder.

  Then Set the configuration as below :

  ```

  drush cset az_migration.settings migrate_d7_public_path "sites/default/files"
  ```

USAGE NOTES
-----------

Nearly any architectural customization or override to a Quickstart 1 site will require a custom module with custom migrations.
Luckily this is fairly simple and only requires a structure shown below:
<webroot>
  * modules/
    * custom/
      * my_migration_module/
        * config/
          * install/
            * migrate_plus.migration_group.my_migration_group.yml
        * migrations/
          * some_migration.yml
          * another_migration.yml
        * my_migration_module.info.yml

Example [migration group file](https://github.com/az-digital/az_quickstart/blob/main/modules/custom/az_migration/config/install/migrate_plus.migration_group.az_migration.yml)
