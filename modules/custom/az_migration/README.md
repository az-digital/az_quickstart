# Introduction

This module provides a collection of ready to use migrations for migrating content from UA Quickstart (Quickstart 1) to Arizona Quickstart (Quickstart 2) as well as a library of migrate process and source plugins to simplify the creation of custom migrations for migrating other content to Quickstart 2.  This module is designed to be used either as an alternative to or in combination with the `migrate_drupal` module provided by Drupal core.


# Requirements

- An archive of a Quickstart 1 (or Drupal 7) site's database or database access credentials
- An archive of a Quickstart 1 (or Drupal 7) site's files directory or HTTP access to the files
- Access to environment to create a Quickstart 2 site on (we recommend a local development environment to begin with)

# Getting started

## Using the Quickstart scaffolding repo (recommended)

In order to simplify the process of getting started with Quickstart migrations, the Arizona Digital team has added some migration-specific features to the [Quickstart Scaffolding Repo](https://github.com/az-digital/az-quickstart-scaffolding).  This repository is designed to be used as a composer project template for new Quickstart 2 website projects.

To get started with a Quickstart 2 migration using the scaffolding repo as a project template, follow the steps in that repository's [README](https://github.com/az-digital/az-quickstart-scaffolding#readme) until you get to the "Migration setup in Lando" section and then follow these steps:

1. Download an archive (dump) of your source site's database.
2. Place the database dump file into the (project) root directory of your new migration project directory.
3. Download an archive of your source site's files directory. This is usually in the
   `sites/default/files` directory of your website
4. Set the site up for migration by running lando commands from root of your new migration project.
   ```
   lando start
   lando install
   lando migrate-setup
   ```
5. Copy your downloaded Drupal 7 site's files into
   `/web/sites/default/files/migrate_files`.
6. Import your Drupal 7 site's database archive with lando replacing
   `<filename>` with the path to your database archive in the root of your new migration project.
   ```
   lando migrate-db-import <filename>
   ```
7. Check the status of the migrations provided by the `az_migration` module.  You should see a migration status table listing the migrations and the number of rows associated with each migration in the source site database.
    ```
    lando drush migrate:status --group=az_migration
    ```
8. Import the `az_migration` group.
    ```
    lando drush migrate:import --group=az_migration
    ```
9. Check output of the migration import cammand take note of any errors.
10. Log into the lando site and review the imported content.

You can skip most of the rest of this README unless you run into trouble.


## Manual installation and configuration

  ### Module installation

  * Install the module using the below command.

  ```
    drush en az_migration
  ```

  ### Configure the settings.php to connect source database

  Please modify and add the below connection string to the settings.php

  ```
  $databases['migrate']['default'] = [
    'driver' => 'mysql',
    'namespace' => 'Drupal\Core\Database\Driver\mysql',
    'database' => 'databasename',
    'username' => 'databaseusername',
    'password' => 'databasepassword',
    'port' => 'databaseport',
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'prefix' => '',
  ];
  ```

  ### Before running the file migration, please configure the file location.

  Files can be migrated in two ways as depicted below:

  #### 1. Copy the source site files to the "sites/default/files/migrate_file" folder.

  Then set the configuration as below:

  ```
  drush cset az_migration.settings migrate_d7_filebasepath " "
  drush cset az_migration.settings migrate_d7_public_path "sites/default/files/migrate_file"
  ```

  #### 2. Can directly configure the remote url for the file as below

  Set the configuration as below :
  Example filebasepath: `example.arizona.edu`

  ```
  drush cset az_migration.settings migrate_d7_protocol "https"
  drush cset az_migration.settings migrate_d7_filebasepath "example.arizona.edu"
  drush cset az_migration.settings migrate_d7_public_path "sites/default/files"
  ```

# Post migration steps

After migrating content, the `migrate` database connection should be removed
from your site's `settings.php` file.  This will prevent the issues with the
migrations being loaded by the Drupal plugin system and interfering with
Quickstart features that use the migrate API (e.g. Quickstart News Feeds and
Quickstart Global Footer).  This is especially important if the source site
has been shut down or is on an environment that suspends idle
servers/containers (e.g. Pantheon).

The `migrate` database connection can be added back to the site's
`settings.php` file as needed (e.g. if additional content migrations need to
be run or rerun after the initial migration is complete) as long as the source
site's database is available.



# Writing custom migrations

Nearly any architectural customization or override to a Quickstart 1 site will require a custom module with custom migrations.
Luckily this is fairly simple and only requires a structure shown below:
<webroot>
  * modules/
    * custom/
      * my_migration_module/
        * config/
          * install/
            * migrate_plus.migration_group.my_migration_group.yml
        * migrations/
          * some_migration.yml
          * another_migration.yml
        * my_migration_module.info.yml

Example [migration group file](https://github.com/az-digital/az_quickstart/blob/main/modules/custom/az_migration/config/install/migrate_plus.migration_group.az_migration.yml)

Compare source site pathauto settings to ensure new content and migrated content are consistent.

## Exclude Node Title Migration

This migration uses migration_lookup to match source node id to the nid of
migrated content.

Optional Migration Dependencies:
Optional dependencies are honored in the correct order if the group import is run.
`drush migrate:import --group=az_migration`
If the variable doesn't exist in the source db, it will stop immediately and move on.
- az_node_carousel
- az_node_event
- az_node_flexible_page
- az_node_news
- az_node_person
- az_node_uaqs_basic_page_to_az_page

Quickstart 1 exclude node title per node settings can be migrated using the
following command:

```
drush mim az_exclude_node_title
```
You do have the option to run this migration as many times as necessary.
To update content after running additional quickstart migrations:

```
drush mim az_exclude_node_title --update
```

To rollback menu links, use the following command:
```
drush mr az_exclude_node_title
```

# Useful modules

When debugging migrations, the [Migrate
Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_devel) module can be used to print source
and destination values on the screen when importing or rolling back via `drush`.
