# Quickstart Global Footer

Enabling the Quickstart Global Footer module on your site will add default UArizona resource and social media links to your footer.

You must have administrator permissions in order to enable this module.

## Considerations Before You Enable the Module

Before you enable this module on your site, ensure you don't already have menu links in the `Footer - Main` menu. If you do, you will want to consider moving those links to a new/custom menu (or simply make note of them) if you would still like to use them.

Enabling this module will overwrite any pre-existing menu items in the `Footer - Main` menu. (still testing this to see what happens)
