# Quickstart International
The Quickstart International module enables site editors to provide language translations for their site content. This module only provides the functionality necessary to serve content in multiple languages, and does not provide content translations themselves. It is up to the site owner(s) to provide translations for their site's content. 

## Requirements

- To enable this feature on your site, someone with an `administrator` role must perform the below "Configuration" steps on your site.
- To make content translations on your site, you must have the `content administrator` role (as you will need access to menus).

## Instructions

### Configuration

1. Enable the module.
2. Navigate to `/admin/config/regional/language` and install the desired language(s) and clear caches.
3. Navigate to `/admin/structure/block` and place the  "Language Switcher" block in the desired region. It is recommended that you place the block above the page title (whether in a separate region, or just have the block display above the page title in the Content region).
   - You can choose to limit the block to specific pages or sections of your site (if you're not translating your entire site).
   - You can choose to place the block site-wide.
   - You can choose to place the block only on specific content types.

### Adding Translations

1. Navigate to a piece of content that you want to translate.
2. Click on the "Translate" tab (near the "Edit" tab).
3. Click opn "Edit" for the language(s) you wish to add translations for.
