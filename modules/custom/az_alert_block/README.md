# Quickstart Alert Block

Adds an alert block type for site-wide or emergency messages (e.g. campus incidents). Only the **Body** field content is displayed on the front end.

## Setup

When the module is installed, a default **"Emergency Alert Block"** is created and placed in the **Alert** region (disabled), so no manual setup is needed. You can find it under **Structure → Block layout** in the Alert region. To add another block, use **Content → Blocks → Add custom block** and choose "Alert Block", then place it in the Alert region.

## During an incident

1. Edit the block Body at **Content → Blocks** (or `/admin/content/blocks`) → Edit "Emergency Alert Block".
2. Enable the block in **Structure → Block layout** (`/admin/structure/block`).
3. Only the Body content displays; do not change the block description or text colors for the message.

## After the incident

Disable the block in Block layout on each site. The content can remain for the next time; disabling hides the alert.
