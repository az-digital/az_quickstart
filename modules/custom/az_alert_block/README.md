# Quickstart Alert Block

Adds an alert block type for site-wide or emergency messages (e.g. campus incidents). Only the **Body** field content is displayed on the front end.

## Setup

1. Add a custom block at `/block/add/az_alert_block` (or **Structure → Block layout → Place block**).
2. Title the block **"Emergency Alert Block"** so staff can find it consistently across sites.
3. Place the block in the **Alert** region. Leave it **disabled** until needed.

## During an incident

1. Edit the block Body at **Content → Blocks** (or `/admin/content/blocks`) → Edit "Emergency Alert Block".
2. Enable the block in **Structure → Block layout** (`/admin/structure/block`).
3. Only the Body content displays; do not change the block description or text colors for the message.

## After the incident

Disable the block in Block layout on each site. The content can remain for the next time; disabling hides the alert.
