Decades later, after being without a mascot, UA students Richard Heller, '65, and John Paquette, '61 developed the idea for a costumed human mascot. On November 7, 1959, Wilbur the Wildcat was \"born,\" making his debut at the UA vs. Texas Tech football game. The new mascot, portrayed by Ed Stuckenoff, `64, was an immediate hit</p><p> The original costume was head-to-toe fur with an American flag patch on the left shoulder. It was cartoon-style with big round eyes, a button nose, and a curved black line for a mouth. A few years later, in an attempt to look more \"human\", an upgraded version of Wilbur eliminated the fur body and replaced it with an Arizona sweater and pair of slacks. This look lasted until the 1970's, during which Wilbur underwent a \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" phase. In this costume, Wilbur donned a vest and blue jeans, cowboy boots, a holster and gun, and an oversized paper-mache head. This look lasted until 1982, when Wilbur re-acquired his fur.</p><p>Since the early 1980's, Wilbur the Wildcat's character and image has undergone various style changes while maintaining a \"furry\" body. Today, Wilbur, along with his counterpart and wife, Wilma the Wildcat, and the Arizona Cheerleaders, is part of the Spirit Program within Arizona Athletics Department. Wilbur is not only present at all UA home football and men's basketball games, but he is also involved in many aspects of campus life. In addition to campus commitments, Wilbur and Wilma the Wildcat spend a great deal of time working with local community organizations and non-profit groups.</p><hr><h2 class=\"h3\">Wildcats Nickname</h2><p>The Wildcats got their name after a hard fought football game against the Occidental College Tigers on November 7, 1914. A Los Angeles Times columnist wrote that the Arizona team \"Showed the fight of Wildcats.\"</p><hr><h2 class=\"h3\">Wilbur Facts</h2><ul><li>The University of Arizona's original mascot was actually a live bobcat, purchased by the freshman football team from army blacksmith F.W. Fawkins, for $9.41. The team presented the bobcat, then called Tom Easter, as a gift to the student body, to whom he was first introduced at an assembly on October 18, 1915.</li><li>Shortly there after he was officially named Rufus Arizona, after then UA President Rufus Bernard Von KleinSmid.</li><li>Rufus Arizona had an untimely death on April 17, 1916. As reported by the Arizona Wildcat, \"while endeavoring to perform gymnastics stunts in the limbs of a tree to which he was tied, Rufus Arizona ... fell and was hung.\" The original Rufus passed on, but successors followed. (Live mascots were used off and on between the early 1900's and the late 1950's.)</li><li>Decades later, UA students Richard Heller, '62, and John Paquette, '60 presented the idea for a costumed human mascot. On November 7, 1959, Wilbur the Wildcat was \"born,\" making his first appearance at the UA vs. Texas Tech football game.

As part of the Spirit Program, Wilbur is not only at virtually every UA home game, but he is also very involved in the Tucson community doing appearances and spending time with kids of all ages.</li><li>Wilbur's primary responsibilities are Football, and Men's Basketball.</li><li>With the exception of a small scholarship ($200) they do it all for the experience.</li><li>In, 2006, Wilbur and Wilma renewed their vow at the ASU to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary.</li></ul>",
