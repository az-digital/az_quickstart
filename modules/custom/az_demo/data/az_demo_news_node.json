      "az_body"  : "<p>Lou Gehrig's disease is a progressive disease marked by the deterioration and death of nerve cells used for voluntary movements such as walking, talking, eating and so much more. It is incurable. TDP-43 is a protein often found forming clumps within the cells of people with ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is known to disrupt healthy protein creation in cells, ultimately leading to cellular demise. Scientists weren't sure how – until now. A University of Arizona-led team has uncovered an important new victim of TDP-43, potentially securing an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to a cure. That target – Dlp, short for Dally-like protein – is critical to the function of healthy neurons.</p>",

      "az_body"  : "If you're thinking about taking up running as your New Year's resolution and still need some convincing, consider this: MRI scans reveal that endurance runners' brains have greater functional connectivity than the brains of more sedentary individuals.\n\nUniversity of Arizona researchers compared brain scans of young adult cross country runners to young adults who don't engage in regular physical activity. The runners, overall, showed greater functional connectivity — or connections between distinct brain regions — within several areas of the brain, including the frontal cortex, which is important for cognitive functions such as planning, decision-making and the ability to switch attention between tasks.\n\nAlthough additional research is needed to determine whether these physical differences in brain connectivity result in differences in cognitive functioning, the current findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, help lay the groundwork for researchers to better understand how exercise affects the brain, particularly in young adults.\n\nUA running expert David Raichlen, an associate professor of anthropology, co-designed the study with UA psychology professor Gene Alexander, who studies brain aging and Alzheimer's disease as a member of the UA's Evelyn F.

But the health benefits of owning a dog may not end there.\n\nResearchers at the University of Arizona are recruiting participants for a study exploring whether dogs can improve human health by having a probiotic effect on the body. The research will focus specifically on dogs' effect on the health of older adults.\n\n\"We've co-evolved with dogs over the millennia, but nobody really understands what it is about this dog-human relationship that makes us feel good about being around dogs,\" said Kim Kelly, an anthropology doctoral student and one of the primary investigators on the study. \"Is it just that they're fuzzy and we like to pet them, or is there something else going on under the skin? The question really is: Has the relationship between dogs and humans gotten under the skin? And we believe it has.\"",
