    "az_body" : "Speaker:\nKate Usherswell, University of Cambridge.\n\nAbstract:\n“Practitioners of magic in the twentieth and later nineteenth centuries such as Crowley and Yates used texts that are (from the most charitable perspective) re-creations rather than representing extant traditions. In the early nineteenth century when Byron wished to portray a magician, he chose a Swiss setting for his Manfred, rather than drawing on anything from his native land. The persecution of witches extending back from the eighteenth through the seventeenth centuries was framed entirely within the accounts of their accusers, not by any independent literary productions. Parallel explorations of astrology and alchemy are best understood in the context of proto-science rather than some independent magical tradition (the much-discussed full collection of Newton's writings being a case in point). In the sixteenth century John Dee has a reasonable claim to be a genuine writer on magic, but this is offset by the tragic arc of his career, from high regard at court to penury and the ridicule of his contemporaries. At around the same time Marlowe turned to the already pan-European legend of Faust for his magician, rather than drawing on anything closer to hand. Figures such as John Damian in the earlier sixteenth century are again best understood as belonging to alchemical proto-science, and in Damian's case his status as a foreigner strengthens the case that there was no insular magical tradition. One has to look several centuries earlier to Michael Scott to find an insular magician famous enough to have acquired a European reputation (Dante consigns him to one of the circles of Hell), and only the entirely legendary Merlin is held in any significant regard.”",

One can look at the towering granite cliffs of Yosemite and suppose that there was a time when oceans of magma existed within the Earth. However geophysical evidence shows that practically everything above the liquid outer core is solid. Even the more fluid aesthenosphere that provides the motility needed for plate tectonics is still a solid in all practical respects, and in highly active areas such as mid-ocean ridges only a small fraction of liquid magma exists at any given time; moreover currently identified magma chambers have many gradations between solid and liquid.\n\nAlthough there have been times of increased volcanic activity in the past (the flood basalts of the Columbia River basin or the Deccan Traps), there is no need to suppose that conditions beneath the earth were significantly different when igneous rocks formed. Deep time provides the correct perspective: the time during which a rock existed as liquid in a magma chamber or lava flow is almost vanishingly small compared to the time it subsequently persisted as a solid. Only the exceptional conditions for one phase of the Earth's earlier history (the postulated Late Heavy Bombardment) would have led to proportionally large volumes of liquified rock.”",

Recently, however, some ecologists have promoted the idea that the only hope for some species to survive projected rapid environmental change is genetic manipulation, either by selective breeding for strains pre-adapted to future conditions or direct genetic engineering. The first indication that breakaway factions in the activist community have embraced this new direction has come from an explosion disrupting logging operations in the Pacific Northwest. Investigation revealed that no bomb had been planted, but that the normal mechanisms of resin formation within the trees themselves had been genetically modified to emplace lenses of high explosive within their bark (giving them the kind of reactive armor used in tanks and other military vehicles). There is a real risk that other species may be weaponized to defend themselves against human interference, and biotechnology research groups at universities are being asked to help identify the dangerous subversives they may be harboring.”",

    "az_body" : "First trained as a painter at the University of Arizona, Winslow-based artist Marlowe Katoney (Diné) was taught to weave by his maternal grandmother in 2010. Since then, Katoney has used a hybrid approach to his weaving practice, combining elements from painting, color theory, perspective, and composition with traditional Navajo iconography and designs.\n\nThe subjects of Katoney's work are varied, as he literally and figuratively weaves traditional imagery with contemporary pictorial practices. Many works directly relate to events in his life, while others are drawn from larger concepts related to popular culture, street art, nature, family, and Navajo culture.\n\nAs the artist explains, \"For me, being an artist is an ongoing pursuit of freedom. It's of the aesthetic of not being limited to the notion of having to abide by the popular [perceptions] of beauty or to create something readily identifiable as being 'Navajo' but instead it's to deconstruct old ideas to create new ones ... Addressing subject matter and composition in this way contextualizes traditional Navajo weaving into contemporary art.\"\n\nPulse features approximately thirty weavings and paintings created over the span of fifteen years that are drawn from both private and public collections. This exhibition is curated by Dr. Anya Montiel, Curator and Native American Art Historian, and Olivia Miller, UAMA Director and Curator.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible through support from the Terra Foundation for American Art.",
