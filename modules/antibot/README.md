# Antibot

Antibot is an extremely lightweight module designed to eliminate robotic form
submissions on your website in an innovative-fashion. The module works
completely behind the scenes and doesn't require any interaction from
the end-users. The only requirement to the end user is that they must have
JavaScript enabled. If they do not, the protected forms will be hidden and a
message will appear, telling the user that the form requires JavaScript be
enabled in order to use it.

[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/antibot).
